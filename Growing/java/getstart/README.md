# Get start for Java environment

## Where to start?
Sure javascript is easier for me, but it kind of hard to know where to start on java.

First, I came to this tutorial [Building an Application with Spring Boot](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/). When I'm about to start I realise that I need to understand better how to start with maven or gradlew.

In result of this first obstacle, I will start by [Building Java Projects with Maven](https://spring.io/guides/gs/maven/) and then [Building Java Projects with Gradle](https://spring.io/guides/gs/gradle/)
