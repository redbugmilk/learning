# Growing

## Presentation

Hello, 

My name is Joana and I am a software developer living in Lisbon.

When I enter on the IT world, I was expecting clowns ðŸ¤¡ but instead I got computers ðŸ–¥ . 

It was hard in the beginning, I had worked with a computer before start University but this didn't helped me, it was very different from knowing how to program. And because it was hard on the beginning, I decided to go to sysadmin, networking and security jobs. But then I realised that I was missing programming. 

So I took the initiative to start to study on my free time, focusing my attention on front end. It wasnâ€™t easy but I finally made it and I got a front end position and I was recognised as a software developer. But now I need more, I need to become a full stack developer. 

So I need to grow again and because of that I need to learn and practice.

Letâ€™s the games begin;

## Purpose

The purpose of this repositiry is to document my studying path through 3 stacks:
 - .Net
 - Java
 - Javascript - always pushing forward towards functional programming. [Reference](https://codeburst.io/a-beginner-friendly-intro-to-functional-programming-4f69aa109569)
